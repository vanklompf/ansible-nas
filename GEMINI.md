# Ansible-NAS Project Context

## Project Overview

Ansible-NAS is an Ansible-based automation project designed to transform a
standard Ubuntu server into a powerful, customizable Network Attached Storage
(NAS) system. It leverages Docker to deploy a wide variety of self-hosted
applications, ranging from media servers (like Plex, Jellyfin) and download
clients (like Transmission, Sabnzbd) to productivity tools (like Nextcloud,
Paperless-ng) and home automation platforms (like Home Assistant).

The core philosophy is to provide a stable, maintainable, and flexible NAS
solution that avoids the pitfalls of monolithic NAS operating systems by using
standard Ubuntu LTS and containerized applications.

## Key Technologies

- **Ansible:** The primary automation tool used for configuring the Ubuntu
server and managing Docker containers.
- **Docker:** Used to run almost all applications, providing isolation and ease
of deployment.
- **Ubuntu LTS:** The target operating system (currently 22.04 LTS).
- **Samba/NFS:** For file sharing over the network.
- **Portainer:** Included for easy management of Docker containers.

## Project Structure

- `nas.yml`: The main Ansible playbook that defines the roles to be executed.
- `group_vars/all.yml`: Contains default configuration variables for the NAS.
- `roles/`: Directory containing individual Ansible roles. Each role typically
corresponds to a specific application or service (e.g., `plex`, `nextcloud`,
`traefik`).
- `roles/<application>/`: Standard Ansible role structure including `tasks/`,
`defaults/`, `templates/`, etc.
- `roles/<application>/defaults/main.yml`: Defines default variables for the
specific application (e.g., enabled status, ports, directories).
- `roles/<application>/tasks/main.yml`: Contains the Ansible tasks to deploy and
configure the application, often involving Docker container management.
- `roles/<application>/docs/`: Documentation for the specific application.
- `website/docs/`: Documentation for the specific application.
- `roles/<application>/molecule/`: Contains tests for the role using Molecule.

## Building, Running, and Testing

- **Setup:** Requires an Ubuntu 22.04 LTS server.
- **Installation:** Follow the official documentation for initial setup, which
involves installing Ansible, cloning the repository, and configuring your
inventory file (usually based on the example in `inventories/`).
- **Configuration:** Customize your NAS by editing
`inventories/<your_inventory>/group_vars/nas.yml`. Enable/disable applications
and adjust settings.
- **Deployment:** Run the main playbook using `ansible-playbook nas.yml -i
inventories/<your_inventory>`.
- **Testing:** Individual roles can be tested using Molecule. Tests are located
in `roles/<application>/molecule/`.

## Development Conventions

- **Adding Applications:** Follow the `hello_world` example role as a template.
This includes providing `defaults`, `tasks`, `docs`, and `molecule` tests.
- **Variables:** Use clear, prefixed variable names (e.g.,
`application_name_enabled`, `application_name_port`).
- **Defaults:** Place sensible defaults in
`roles/<application>/defaults/main.yml`. User-specific overrides go in inventory
files.
- **Documentation:** Add documentation for new applications in
`roles/<application>/docs/` and in `website/docs/` and update the main
`README.md` list.
- **Testing:** Include Molecule tests for new roles.
- **PRs:** Focus on one piece of functionality or bugfix per pull request.
