Habitica is a habit building and productivity app that treats your life like a game. Level up as you complete real-life tasks, lose health if you don't complete your To Do's, and earn rewards by meeting your goals.

## Usage

Set `habitica_enabled: true` in your `inventories/<your_inventory>/group_vars/nas.yml` file.

Habitica web interface can be found at [http://ansible_nas_host_or_ip:8186](http://ansible_nas_host_or_ip:8186).
