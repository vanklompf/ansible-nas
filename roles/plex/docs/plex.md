# Plex

Homepage: <https://www.plex.tv/>

Plex is a personal media server that also provides access to several external movie, web show, and podcast services. Allows you to stream music too. Apps for many devices, including e.g. chromecast integration.

## Usage

Set `plex_enabled: true` in your `inventories/<your_inventory>/nas.yml` file.

The Plex web interface can be found at <http://ansible_nas_host_or_ip:32400/web/index.html>.

## Specific Configuration

You'll need to log in with a plex account, (or possibly claim your server).
You'll need to set up your local file store - go to settings > Manage > Libraries, and add your libraries. These are mounted in the root directory by default.

Optionally, after setting up Plex, you can install [Plex Autoscan](https://github.com/Cloudbox/autoscan). To do that:

- enable `plex_autoscan_enabled`
- set `plex_api_token`
- edit `templates\autoscan_config.j2` to suit your needs
- and run the playbook again.

Also, you can install [Plex Meta Manager](https://metamanager.wiki/) by enabling `plex_metamanager_enabled` and setting the relevant ENV variables. Please also update the `templates/pmm_config.yml.j2` template according to your needs. Please check out [Plex Meta Manager documentation](https://metamanager.wiki/en/latest/config/configuration.html) for details.
