If Gitea isn't powerful enough for you then consider GitLab. It's a much more powerful (and consequently bigger) Git repository solution that includes a suite of code analytics. On the other hand it requires more RAM.

## Usage

Set `gitlab_enabled: true` in your `inventories/<your_inventory>/nas.yml` file.

To make GitLab available externally via Traefik set `gitlab_available_externally: true` in your `inventories/<your_inventory>/nas.yml` file.

Set `gitlab_root_password` to initial root password. The after container creation and start-up login with user `root` and `gitlab_root_password` password. From there you can proceed to create additional users and further configure the application.
