Homepage: [https://github.com/scribble-rs/scribble.rs](https://github.com/scribble-rs/scribble.rs)

Scribble.rs is an alternative to the web-based drawing game skribbl.io. My main problems with skribbl.io were the ads and the fact that a disconnect would cause you to lose your points. On top of that, the automatic word choice was quite annoying and caused some frustration.

## Usage

Set `scribblers_enabled: true` in your `inventories/<your_inventory>/group_vars/nas.yml` file.

Scribble.rs web interface can be found at [http://ansible_nas_host_or_ip:8140](http://ansible_nas_host_or_ip:8183).
