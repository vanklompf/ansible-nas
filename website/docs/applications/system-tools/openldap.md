OpenLDAP Software is an open source implementation of the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol.

## Usage

Set `openldap_enabled: true` in your `inventories/<your_inventory>/nas.yml` file.
Set `openldap_*` variables including the LDAP root, admin user and password, etc. to the values you need.
Set `openldap_ldap_users` and `openldap_ldap_passwords` to automatically create a set of users with their passwords.

OpenLDAP interface can be found at <http://ansible_nas_host_or_ip:1389>.

The role automatically installs phpLDAPadmin alongside OpenLDAP. It can be accessed at <http://ansible_nas_host_or_ip:6443>.
The role also templates/copies phpLDAPadmin custom templates to the container. One example is included in `templates\pla_templates` - you can add more if needed.
